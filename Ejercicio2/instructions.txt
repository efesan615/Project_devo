Requierements: this develop has been built on AJAX using "XAMPP". It's necesary to mount the files on a web server 
for launching the app. For the graphs is also necessary to unzip the "koolreport.zip" folder on the same path thay contains the zip file.

For the correct use of the program it's necessary to launch "main.html" file at first. Here is where the user can add
new datasets with the required formats and plot data already added.

The process to add the data is put on the input box the data and press the button "Add Data"

The process to plot the data in the SQL database is pussing the button "Plot Data". The graphs will open on a new tab.
